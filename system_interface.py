    Vehicles File Format
    --------------------
    The format for the vehicles file contains comma-separated values with the
    indicated header lines for cars, vans, and trucks. 

        #CARS#
        make-model, mpg, num passengers, vin

        mpg, length, num rooms, vin
        .
    
    Vehicle Cost File Format
    ------------------------
    The format for the rental costs file includes a header line, followed
    by three lines of comma-separated values for cars, vans and trucks.
        
        daily, weekly, weekend, free miles, mileage charge, insurance
